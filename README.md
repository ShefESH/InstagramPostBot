# InstagramPostBot
A bot for creating monday session instagram posts by Joshua Rylance (Publicity Officer 2024-25)

## Run instructions: - from folder containing all program files
### linux:
```
sh ./runJar/run.sh 
```

### windows - via command prompt:
```
cd .\runJar\
run.bat
```


## How it works:

Uses Selenium to drive the website. Creates a session post based off the template in canva. 
The template has to be unlocked, other the bot will not work.
The template has to be at the top of the canva page.
Occasionally the design tab will open when running the bot. I am not sure why this happens every so often. Just re run the bot and it will work.
Occasionally the cookies will not be clicked so the bot will stop. Re run the bot and it will work. I believe this is due to the speed of the bot.
Future publicity officers - you can change this if you like, but i prefer sheer speed. 


## Any other question:
You can always send me a message on discord @CrowdedFire :)
